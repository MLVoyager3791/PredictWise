# PredictWise

PredictWise is a Streamlit application designed to simplify the process of data cleaning, model training, and evaluation. The app allows users to upload datasets in CSV, TSV, or Excel formats, handle missing values, visualize data, and automatically train multiple machine learning models using LazyPredict. It supports both classification and regression tasks and displays comprehensive evaluation metrics.

## Features
- Upload CSV, TSV, or Excel files for analysis
- Automatic data cleaning and handling of missing values
- View data distribution and correlation matrix.
- Selection of feature variables (X) and target variable (Y)
- Automatic model training and evaluation using LazyPredict
- Display of evaluation metrics for the best models

## How to Use
1. **Upload File:**\
Click the "Browse files" button to upload your dataset in CSV, TSV, or Excel format.

2. **Data Cleaning:**\
The application will display the count of null values for each column.\
Choose how to handle missing values: Replace with Mean, Median, or Drop the rows with missing values.

3. **Select X and Y Variables:**\
Select the feature variables (X) and the target variable (Y) from the dropdown menus.

4. **Train Model:**\
The data will be split into training and testing sets.\
Click the "Run LazyPredict" button to automatically train multiple machine learning models.

5. **View Results:**\
The application will display the performance metrics for all the models trained.\
Detailed evaluation metrics for the best model will be shown.

1. **Upload File:**\
Click the "Browse files" button to upload a dataset in CSV, TSV, or Excel format.

2. **Data Cleaning:**\
The app will show the count of null values for each column.\
Choose a method for handling missing values: Mean, Median, Mode, Drop Rows, or Drop Columns.

3. **Data Visualization:**\
Check the boxes to view the data distribution and correlation matrix.

4. **Select X and Y Variables:**\
Select feature variables (X) and the target variable (Y) from the dropdown menus.\
Optionally, select all features as X.

5. **Train Model:**\
Click "Run LazyPredict" to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.\
For classification tasks, LazyClassifier will be used. For regression tasks, LazyRegressor will be used.\
View evaluation metrics for the best models and a scatter plot comparing predictions to actual values.
